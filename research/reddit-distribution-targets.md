## Subreddits to Target

## Strategy
1. **Don't spam** — genuinely engage in threads, share value first
2. **Comment on existing threads** before making new posts
3. **Lead with the pain** ("We were frustrated with Canny's pricing too...")
4. **Show, don't tell** — screenshots, live demo link
5. **Time new posts** for weekday mornings (US) for max engagement
6. **Create a "Show r/SaaS" launch post** with the backstory

## Key Messaging
- "$49/mo flat — no tracked-user nonsense"
- "AI duplicate detection saves you hours"
- "Built by a solo founder who got tired of paying $1,200/year for a feedback board"
- "Your users shouldn't cost you more when they engage more"
