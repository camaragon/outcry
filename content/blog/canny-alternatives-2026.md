# Best Canny Alternatives in 2026

If you're searching for a **Canny alternative**, you're not alone. Canny has been a go-to feedback tool for years, but its tracked-user pricing model — which starts at $99/mo and scales to $1,349/mo as your user base grows — has pushed many SaaS teams to look elsewhere.

In 2026, the feedback tool landscape is more competitive than ever. New entrants with AI-native features, flat pricing, and modern UIs are giving Canny serious competition. Whether you're a bootstrapped startup or a scaling SaaS company, there's likely a better fit for your budget and workflow.

In this guide, we compare the **best Canny alternatives in 2026**, covering pricing, features, pros, cons, and who each tool is best for. Let's dive in.

## Why Teams Are Leaving Canny

Before we look at alternatives, it's worth understanding why so many teams are actively searching for a Canny replacement:

- **Tracked-user pricing is unpredictable.** Canny charges based on "tracked users" — anyone who votes, comments, or submits feedback. As your product grows, so does your bill. Teams regularly report surprise invoices when a feature goes viral or they launch a public board.
- **The free plan was gutted.** Canny's free tier is extremely limited, making it hard to evaluate the product properly before committing.
- **No built-in AI.** Despite AI being table stakes in 2026, Canny still lacks native AI features like duplicate detection or auto-categorization.
- **Dated UI.** While functional, Canny's interface hasn't kept pace with newer, more polished competitors.

If any of these resonate, keep reading — there are excellent alternatives available now.

## 1. Outcry — Best Overall Canny Alternative

**Pricing:** $49/mo flat (unlimited users, unlimited boards, AI included)
**Free tier:** 1 board, 50 posts, no AI
**Website:** [outcry.app](https://outcry.app)

Outcry is the newest entrant in the feedback tool space, and it's built differently. Rather than bolting AI onto an existing product, Outcry was designed from day one as an **AI-native feedback platform**.

### What Makes Outcry Stand Out

- **Flat $49/mo pricing.** No tracked users, no per-seat charges, no surprises. One price, unlimited everything.
- **AI duplicate detection.** When users submit feedback, Outcry uses embeddings and vector search to surface similar existing posts with a "Did you mean...?" prompt. This alone saves teams hours of manual merging per week.
- **Modern stack.** Built on Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui — the interface feels fast and contemporary.
- **Public feedback boards + roadmap.** Each workspace gets a custom subdomain (yourcompany.outcry.app) with a public board and kanban roadmap.
- **Stripe-powered billing** with a generous free tier to get started.

### Who It's Best For

SaaS teams that want a modern, affordable feedback tool with AI built in — not bolted on. Especially compelling for teams currently paying $99–$400/mo on Canny for features Outcry includes at $49/mo.

### Potential Drawbacks

- Newer product (launched 2026), so the ecosystem is still growing.
- No embeddable widget yet (planned for v1.5).
- No Slack/Jira integrations yet (also planned).

**Verdict:** If you want the best value-for-money Canny alternative with genuine AI capabilities, Outcry is our top pick.

## 2. Featurebase

**Pricing:** Free plan available; paid plans from $29/seat/mo
**Website:** [featurebase.app](https://featurebase.app)

Featurebase has positioned itself as the modern Canny alternative and has gained significant traction. It offers feedback boards, roadmaps, changelogs, and a knowledge base in one platform.

### Pros

- Clean, modern UI that feels polished.
- Comprehensive feature set — feedback, roadmap, changelog, and surveys all in one.
- Good integrations (Slack, Linear, Jira, Intercom).
- In-app widget for collecting feedback without leaving your product.
- AI-powered features including smart duplicate detection and auto-translation.

### Cons

- **Per-seat pricing adds up.** At $29/seat/mo, a team of 5 is already paying $145/mo — nearly 3x what Outcry charges for unlimited seats.
- Some advanced features locked behind higher tiers.
- The free plan is limited and pushes you toward paid quickly.

### Who It's Best For

Mid-size teams that need an all-in-one feedback suite and don't mind per-seat pricing. If you're a solo founder or small team, the per-seat model may sting.

## 3. Frill

**Pricing:** From $25/mo
**Website:** [frill.co](https://frill.co)

Frill is a lightweight feedback tool that covers the basics well: idea boards, roadmaps, and announcements. It's been around for several years and has a loyal following among small teams.

### Pros

- Simple, clean interface that's easy to set up.
- Affordable starting price.
- Embeddable widget available.
- Changelog / announcements feature built in.
- Custom domain support.

### Cons

- **Limited AI capabilities.** No duplicate detection, no auto-categorization.
- The UI, while clean, feels a bit dated compared to 2026 standards.
- Analytics and reporting are basic.
- Limited integrations compared to Featurebase or Canny.

### Who It's Best For

Small teams or indie hackers who want a simple, affordable feedback board without the complexity of larger tools. If you don't need AI features, Frill gets the job done.

## 4. Nolt

**Pricing:** From $29/mo
**Website:** [nolt.io](https://nolt.io)

Nolt is another lightweight Canny alternative focused on simplicity. It's a straightforward feedback board with voting — no roadmap, no changelog, just feedback collection done well.

### Pros

- Extremely simple to set up — you can be live in minutes.
- Clean, focused UI.
- Supports custom domains and branding.
- SSO support on higher tiers.
- Good for teams that just want a feedback board, nothing more.

### Cons

- **Very limited feature set.** No roadmap view, no changelog, no AI.
- No free plan — only a 14-day trial.
- Minimal analytics.
- No native integrations beyond Zapier.

### Who It's Best For

Very small teams or early-stage startups that want the simplest possible feedback collection. If you'll eventually need roadmaps or AI, you'll outgrow Nolt quickly.

## 5. Upvoty

**Pricing:** From $15/mo
**Website:** [upvoty.com](https://upvoty.com)

Upvoty is one of the most affordable Canny alternatives on the market. It offers feedback boards with voting, a roadmap view, and a changelog — all at a lower price point than most competitors.

### Pros

- Very affordable — one of the cheapest options available.
- Covers the core feedback loop: boards, roadmap, changelog.
- Custom domain support.
- Embeddable widget.
- Supports multiple boards and languages.

### Cons

- **Dated user interface.** The design hasn't been significantly updated and feels a generation behind.
- No AI features whatsoever.
- Limited reporting and analytics.
- Support can be slow based on community feedback.
- No SSO on lower tiers.

### Who It's Best For

Budget-conscious teams that prioritize low cost over modern UX. If you just need basic feedback boards at the lowest possible price, Upvoty delivers.

## 6. ProductBoard

**Pricing:** From $19/maker/mo (paid plans from $25/maker/mo for useful features)
**Website:** [productboard.com](https://productboard.com)

ProductBoard is less of a direct Canny alternative and more of a full product management platform. It includes feedback collection, but also prioritization frameworks, roadmapping, and portfolio management.

### Pros

- Comprehensive product management suite — goes far beyond feedback.
- Powerful prioritization frameworks (RICE, weighted scoring).
- Excellent integrations with Jira, Slack, Zendesk, Intercom, Salesforce.
- Customer insights portal for aggregating feedback from multiple sources.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

### Cons

- **Expensive at scale.** Per-maker pricing means costs climb with your PM team. A team of 5 makers on the Pro plan pays $375/mo.
- **Overkill for feedback collection.** If you just want feedback boards + roadmap, you're paying for a lot of features you won't use.
- Steep learning curve compared to simpler tools.
- The feedback portal (customer-facing board) is less polished than dedicated tools.

### Who It's Best For

Larger product teams that need a full product management platform, not just a feedback tool. If you already use ProductBoard for roadmapping, its built-in feedback features may be "good enough." But if feedback is your primary need, a dedicated tool is a better choice.

---

## 7. UserVoice

**Pricing:** Enterprise only (reportedly $899+/mo)
**Website:** [uservoice.com](https://uservoice.com)

UserVoice is the OG of feedback tools — it's been around since 2008. Today, it's squarely an enterprise product with enterprise pricing to match.

### Pros

- Mature, battle-tested platform with deep analytics.
- Excellent for large organizations with complex feedback needs.
- Advanced segmentation — slice feedback by customer revenue, plan tier, etc.
- Salesforce and Zendesk integrations are best-in-class.
- Dedicated customer success team.

### Cons

- **Extreme pricing.** No public pricing; reportedly starts around $899/mo and goes much higher. Completely out of reach for startups and small teams.
- No free plan or trial without talking to sales.
- Dated interface.
- Overkill for 99% of SaaS teams.

### Who It's Best For

Enterprise companies with dedicated product ops teams and the budget to match. If you're reading a "Canny alternatives" article, UserVoice is probably not the right fit — it's solving a different scale of problem.

## 8. Sleekplan

**Pricing:** Free plan available; paid from $13/mo
**Website:** [sleekplan.com](https://sleekplan.com)

Sleekplan is a budget-friendly feedback tool that also includes NPS surveys and CSAT tracking — a unique combo at this price point.

### Pros

- Very affordable with a usable free tier.
- Includes NPS and CSAT surveys alongside feedback boards.
- In-app widget for embedded feedback.
- Changelog feature included.
- Custom domain support.

### Cons

- Limited AI capabilities.
- The interface is functional but not particularly polished.
- Smaller team behind the product — slower feature development.
- Integrations are limited compared to larger competitors.

### Who It's Best For

Small teams that want feedback boards plus basic survey/NPS functionality at a low price. A solid budget option, though you sacrifice polish and AI features.

---

## 9. Fider

**Pricing:** Free (open source, self-hosted)
**Website:** [fider.io](https://fider.io)

Fider is the open-source option. If you want full control over your feedback tool and have the technical chops to self-host, Fider is worth considering.

### Pros

- Completely free and open source.
- Full control over your data.
- Simple, clean interface for basic feedback collection.
- Supports custom domains, OAuth, and multi-language.
- Active community.

### Cons

- **You manage everything.** Hosting, updates, backups, security — it's all on you.
- Very basic feature set — no AI, no roadmap, no changelog.
- No official support (community only).
- UI is dated.

### Who It's Best For

Developer-heavy teams that want a free, self-hosted feedback tool and don't mind managing infrastructure. Not ideal for non-technical teams or those who need advanced features.

## How to Choose the Right Canny Alternative

Choosing the best feedback tool depends on your team size, budget, and what you actually need. Here's a quick decision framework:

### Choose Outcry if...
You want the best balance of price, features, and AI. At $49/mo flat with AI duplicate detection, it's the most cost-effective option for growing SaaS teams. No tracked-user surprises, no per-seat scaling.

### Choose Featurebase if...
You need an all-in-one suite (feedback + roadmap + changelog + surveys) and your team is small enough that per-seat pricing stays reasonable.

### Choose Frill or Nolt if...
You want dead-simple feedback collection and don't need AI. Frill has more features; Nolt is simpler.

### Choose Upvoty or Sleekplan if...
Budget is your primary concern and you can live without AI features or a polished UI.

### Choose ProductBoard if...
You need full product management, not just feedback collection. ProductBoard makes sense when feedback is one piece of a larger product ops workflow.

### Choose Fider if...
You have engineering resources, want full data control, and don't mind self-hosting.

### Choose UserVoice if...
You're an enterprise with complex feedback workflows, revenue-weighted prioritization needs, and the budget to match.

## The Bottom Line

Canny built the category, but its tracked-user pricing model hasn't aged well. In 2026, there's no reason to pay $99–$1,349/mo for features that newer tools offer at a fraction of the cost — often with AI capabilities Canny still lacks.

For most SaaS teams, **Outcry** offers the best combination of modern AI features, clean UX, and predictable flat pricing at $49/mo. It's purpose-built for the teams Canny has priced out.

If Outcry's newer product status gives you pause, Featurebase is a mature alternative — just budget for per-seat costs as your team grows.

Whatever you choose, the days of overpaying for feedback boards are over. Your users deserve to be heard — and your budget deserves to be respected.
